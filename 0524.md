1. Scope in JS
    - Variables inside a function are local variables
    - Variables outside a function are global variables

2. Calculating total CPU usage with JS

    - `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` returns the number of logical processors available to run threads on the user's computer.
    - We can use this to calculate the total CPU usage of the user's computer.

        ```js
        const logicalProcessors = navigator.hardwareConcurrency;
        const cpuUsage = logicalProcessors / 100;
        ```

3. Difference with `undefined`, `null`, and `NaN`
    - `undefined`: a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
    - `null`: a variable that has been explicitly assigned to nothing
    - `NaN`: a variable that is not a number
