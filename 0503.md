1. 대용량 소켓통신 시 통신 문제 발생할 경우?
    - Change maxPayload param on server side  
    - Increase maxHttpBuffer size
    - Stress testing: Load testing with Artillery

    <https://socket.io/docs/v4/load-testing/>

2. Load test v. Stress test  
    - Load: show how system behaves under unexpected load
    - Stress: upper limits of capacity using load beyond expected maxiumum

3. Load balancing to scale Socket.io

4. AWS deal with server stress
    - Load balancing

    - Auto scaling

5. AWS architecture  
    - Cloudfront: CDN (proxy server) -> connects to S3 (File server)
    - Route 53: DNS (사용자를 어플리케이션으로 라우팅)
    - Internet gateway -> connects to ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
    - Availiability zone: a single Data Center or a group of Data Centers in a region
    - VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
    - Public subnet: 외부 접근 가능 -> NAT(Network Address Translation- 네트워크 주소 변환) gateway 통해서 private subnet 접근
    - Private subnet: 내부 서브넷 + scaling
    - DB subnet: 백업을 위한 다른 availability zone에 replica 두기

6. HTTP and Socket
    - HTTP:  A client sends a request to a server and waits for a response. The server then processes the request and sends back a response.
    - Socket:  Provides a persistent, bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server. In a socket connection, a client and server establish a connection and can then send and receive data in real-time without the need for continuous requests and responses.
    - Using both are possible (use HTTP to send POST request, use Socket for real-time chatting)
