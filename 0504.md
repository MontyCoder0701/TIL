1. Ping v. Heartbeat v. Polling
    - Ping: Send packet to specific IP. In the context of web communication protocols, ping is typically used to diagnose network issues and is not used as a mechanism for maintaining a stable connection.  

    - Heartbeat: If a response is not received within a certain time interval, it can indicate that the connection has been lost, and appropriate actions can be taken to reconnect or close the connection. -> *Best way to maintain stable socket connection*

    - Polling: Polling is a mechanism used to request and receive data from a server by sending periodic requests at a regular interval. Polling is typically used when the client needs to receive periodic updates from the server. -> *For HTTP connection at specific interval*

2. Socket connection recovery
    <https://socket.io/docs/v4/connection-state-recovery>
    - Socket connection can "inevitably" occur
    - Use "recovery" for quick disconnections

    ```js
    const io = new Server(httpServer, {

    connectionStateRecovery: {
        // the backup duration of the sessions and the packets
        maxDisconnectionDuration: 2 *60* 1000,
        // whether to skip middlewares upon successful recovery
        skipMiddlewares: true,
    }
    });
    ```

    - For server

    ```js
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {

    if (socket.recovered) {
        // recovery was successful: socket.id, socket.rooms and socket.data were restored
    } else {
        // new or unrecoverable session
    }
    });
    ```

    - For client

    ```js
    socket.on("connect", () => {
    if (socket.recovered) {
        // any missed packets will be received
    } else {
        // new or unrecoverable session
    }
    });
    ```
